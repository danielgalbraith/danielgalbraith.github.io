						<p> In my PhD research, I focused especially on <b>syntax</b> and <b>semantics</b> answering the following questions:
						<ul>
<li>How do we express the roles played by different participants in a sentence, i.e. pick out who does what to whom?</li>
<li>How is this aspect of meaning encoded into word order and/or parts of words?</li>
<li>How do languages differ in the way these roles are expressed, and how can we explain generalisations across languages?</li>
</ul></p>

<p>Another area I have worked on is <b>metrical phonology</b>, answering the questions: <ul>
<li>What are the sound rules or constraints that govern stress in words and sentences?</li>
<li>How can we predict sentence-level stress from human-annotated data?</li>
<li>What are the relevant factors that contribute to perceived stress?</li></p>

The main language I worked on is Faroese. I have long-term interests in Nordic languages more broadly, Romance languages, and Lithuanian.

						<h3>The Predictable Case of Faroese</h3>
						<h4>Spring 2015&#8212;Summer 2018</h4>
						<p>Advisor: Paul Kiparsky.
						<p>My thesis project focused on a phenomenon known as "quirky case" in Faroese and Icelandic, where the subject of the sentence is marked with a case not typical of subjects (e.g. dative). The key question is: why does the object in such sentences get marked accusative in Faroese but nominative in Icelandic?
	I proposed a model of grammar which I call <b>Optimal Linking Grammar</b>, combining Linking Theory (Kiparsky 1997, 2001), Optimality Theory (Prince and Smolensky 1993) applied to syntax, and a Competing Grammars model of linguistic variation. The hypotheses were tested against substantial new data gathered on my fieldwork trips to the Faroe Islands and Iceland. I show that the OLG model explains the data in question, and is readily adaptable to a wide range of other sentence types and languages beyond Scandinavian.</p>

						<h3>Faroese ballad meter</h3>
						<h4>Spring 2014&#8212;Summer 2015</h4>
						<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Nncdbtq2_MM" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
						<p>The Faroese <i>kvæði</i>, a tradition of sung ballads accompanied by a ringdance, provide an excellent opportunity for examining the relation between meter and rhythm, and hence for refining current metrical theory. In a study of a sample of ballad texts and recordings, I argue that:
<ul>
<li>the Faroese data are best accounted for by a correspondence constraint-based metrical grammar, whilst an iterative rule-based account (Fabb and Halle 2008) misses generalisations and overgenerates;</li>
<li>while evidence from the ringdance indicates a general alignment between metrical and musical rhythm, there is not always a one-to-one mapping; whenever such a mismatch occurs, a rhythmic principle of binarity nonetheless applies in performance.</li> 
</ul>
</p>
						<h3>US Presidential Speeches Project</h3>
						<h4>Summer 2016-Winter 2017</h4>
						<p>Worked with Arto Anttila, Tim Dozat and Naomi Shapiro on project to annotate US Presidents' inaugural addresses for metrical stress.</p>
						<h3>Fieldwork</h3>
						<ul>
						<li>Two and a half month research trip to the Faroe Islands for gathering syntactic data, April-June 2017.</li>
						<li>Video and audio recordings of ballad performances by <a href="http://vagadansifelag.fo" style="text-decoration:none">Vága dansifelag</a> conducted on September 6 2014 at Miðvágur, Faroe Islands.</li>
						</ul>
